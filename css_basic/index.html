        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          I am Kenny, and I am starting my journey as a frontend developer. I am
          learning how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This
          portfolio shows some of the things I am working on as I improve my
          skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently learning frontend web development, focusing on HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript. I am working on small projects to practice and
          improve my skills step by step. Although I am still mastering these
          technologies, I am excited about growing and building useful websites
          in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy learning how to code because it lets me create things that
          people can use and enjoy. Every day, I spend time practicing and
          exploring new topics in web development. I am excited to keep growing
          and getting better at building websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to connect with others who share my interest in coding.
          Feel free to reach out to me on social media or check out my projects
          on GitHub. I am eager to learn from others and grow in this field.
